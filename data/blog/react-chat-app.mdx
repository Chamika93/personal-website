Building a chat app is a really good way to practise the skills you learn in any programming language. I have never build a 
chat using react so finally decided to give it a try.


#### Getting started 

I first came up with the feature that I want to integrate in to the application.

- A user should be able to create a chat by putting their name
- User should be able to send the chat url and let the others to join the chat
- Others should be able to put their name and join the chat
- User should not be logged out of the chat on a reload

So looking at the required features list it is evident that there should be someway to store the user details ( state ) in the browser
environment to keep the user in the chat. Initially I came up with a way to generate a user id and store it in the browser storage,
but later I found out that firebase offers a feature called [anoynmous auth](https://firebase.google.com/docs/auth/web/anonymous-auth) which
create and use temporary anonymous accounts to authenticate with Firebase. This is perfect for our application.
