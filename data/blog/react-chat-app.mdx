Building a chat app is a really good way to practise the skills you learn in any programming language. I have never build a 
chat using react so finally decided to give it a try.


### Getting started 

I first came up with a MVP by lisiting the features that I wanted to integrate in to the application.

- A user should be able to create a chat by putting their name.
- User should be able to send the chat url and let the others to join the chat.
- Others should be able to put their name and join the chat.
- User should not be logged out of the chat on a reload.

So looking at the required features list it is evident that there should be someway to store the user details ( state ) in the browser
environment to keep the user in the chat. Initially I came up with a way to generate a user id and store it in the browser storage,
but later I found out that firebase offers a feature called [anoynmous auth](https://firebase.google.com/docs/auth/web/anonymous-auth) which
create and use temporary anonymous accounts to authenticate with Firebase. This is perfect for our application.
 
Then the most important part is to store the messages and keep the real time communication between users. Eventhough web socket is perfect for something
like this I thought of trying firebase firstore database.  Cloud Firestore is a flexible, scalable no sql database. In cloud firestore data is stored as 
documents and organised in to collections. Documents can contain complex nested objects in addition to subcollection.

### Create the chat

When user clicks on the create chat button code need to create a user and store the user name in the db and then create a new document in the
chat collection for the chat room. After required data is stored in the database user should be directed to the chat.

This is the onClickHandler attached to the create chat button. We have used firebase anonymous authentication to get a unique id for each user
and then we create a document ( similar to a row in mysql ) in _user_ collection ( similar to a table in mysql ). We save the username which we get
from the input field to the user document.  Then we create a document in the _chats_ collection this document uid will be used to generate a unique
url for that chat room.

```js
  const onClickHandler = async ( userName ) => {
      let { user }  = await firebase.auth().signInAnonymously().catch(alert);

      await db.collection("user").doc(user?.uid).set({
        name: userName
      })
 
      var newChatRef = db.collection("chats").doc();

      newChatRef.set({
        admin: user?.uid,
      })
      navigate(`/chat/${newChatRef.id}`)
    }
```

### Sending and recieving messages

Since we are using firebase firestore which has realtime database capabilities we only need to write and listen to the chats collection to
send and receive messages. 

Lets look at how we can send messages.

```js
const messageRef = db.collection("chats").doc(id).collection("messages").doc();
const onSendHandler = async (message) => {
  await messageRef.set({
    text: message,
    user: user,
    createdAt: firebase.firestore.FieldValue.serverTimestamp(),
  })
}
```

In firestore we can create subcollections inside documents. So for each new message we create a new document inside the
_messages_ sub collection in that specific chat room document. We need to add a timestamp to each message to order them
when we recieve messages.

Folowing code block recieve the messages and oreder them in the write order.

```js
  const messagesRef = db.collection("chats").doc(id).collection("messages");
  const query = messagesRef.orderBy('createdAt').limit(25);
  const [messages] = useCollectionData(query, { idField: 'id' });
```

We used `useCollectionData` hook to listen to the chat messages sub collection. So each time we have a new message `messages`
array is updated with all the messages.


Full code for the chat app can be found in [here](https://github.com/Chamika93/quick-chat). and it is deployed to this [url](https://quick-chat-flax.vercel.app/)
if you need to have a quick look.
