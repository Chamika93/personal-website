References in react differs a little bit from your usual react stuff ( Hooks , rendering etc .. ) Because of that sometimes 
it is a little bit hard to understand. I had a hard time trying to wrap my head around this concept. 

#### Why is it different ? 

In react we are not usually allowed to or able to directly access dom elements. React is a declarative javascript
library to build complex user interfaces.  The important keyword here is declarative. In declarative programming we don't 
directly access elements which is called [imperative programming](https://stackoverflow.com/a/33656983) instead we describe 
the UI and programme re-renders according to our description.

<Image
  alt={`React ref model`}
  src={`/static/images/react-refs/image1.jpg`}
  width={1000}
  height={548}
/>

But there are some times we need to access dom elements which we canâ€™t avoid like Managing focus, text selection, 
or media playback. In these cases we need a connection with a dom element to manipulate it the way we want. Then comes the 
React refs to the rescue , it provides the ability to create a direct connection ( reference ) to the element we want to change.


Lets try to understand this by comparing this with normal javascript code.

In Vanilla javascript if we want to focus a button we can use the following code snippet.
<code />


But if we  want to do the same thing in react there is no proper way to do this without using refs.

Solution : 
<code />

#### Accessing elements in Child Component


What if we want to access a child element button from a parent component function, how we are going to do this ?

<Image
  alt={`React ref model`}
  src={`/static/images/react-refs/image2.png`}
  width={1000}
  height={548}
/>

In class components this is fairly straightforward. We simply pass down the ref. But in functional components we can't do
this so we have to wrap the functional component in a React.forwardRef to make it work.
